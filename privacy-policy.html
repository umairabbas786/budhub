We share user information solely and exclusively as described below.</p>
                    <p class="text"><b>Third-Party Service Providers:</b> We use third-party services to perform certain functions on our behalf and through our website and services. Examples include processing payments, sending emails, analyzing data (Google Analytics), creating ads (Facebook, Google), providing marketing assistance and delivering search results.</p>
                    <p class="text">These third-party services and tools may have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use that information for other purposes. Information shared with these third-party services will be treated and stored in accordance with their respective privacy policies and our privacy policy. </p>
                    <p class="text"><b>Business Transfers:</b> In the event that Bud Hub creates, merges with, or is acquired by another entity, your information will most likely be transferred. Bud Hub will email you or place a prominent notice on our website before your information becomes subject to another privacy policy.</p>
                    <p class="text"><b>Protection of Bud Hub and others:</b> We release personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce or apply our Terms and conditions and other agreements, or protect the rights, property, or safety of Bud Hub, our users or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</p>

                    <p class="text"><strong>7. PROTECTING YOUR INFORMATION</strong></p>
                    <p class="text">We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you provide or share through the website. If transactions are processed on the website, transaction information is transmitted to and from the website in encrypted form using industry-standard SSL connections to help protect such information from interception. We restrict authorized access to your personal information to those persons who have a legitimate need to know such information to provide certain functions and to those persons you have authorized to have access to such information. Bud Hub follows generally accepted industry standards for data security to protect the personal information you provide and share through the website, both during transmission and once Bud Hub receives it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while Bud Hub strives to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. We will not sell, distribute or lease your personal information to third parties unless we have your permission or are required by law to do so.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p class="text"><strong>8. RIGHTS </strong></p>

                    <p class="text"><b>Object:</b> When we process your information based on our legitimate interests as explained above, or in the public interest, you may object to this processing in certain circumstances.

                    <p class="text"><b>Revoke consent:</b> Where you have previously given your consent, such as to allow us to process and store your personal information, you have the right to revoke your consent to the processing and storage of your information at any time. For example, you may withdraw your consent by updating your settings. In certain cases, we may continue to process your information after you have withdrawn your consent if we have a legal basis for doing so or if your withdrawal of consent was limited to certain processing activities.</p>
                    <p class="text"><b>Complaint:</b> If you wish to file a complaint about our use of your information (and without prejudice to any other rights you may have), you have the right to do so with your local supervisory authority.
