There may be a pending transaction on your account until your card issuing bank withdraws the authorization. This usually takes 2 to 5 working days. Your card may be declined for a number of reasons, such as insufficient funds, AVS (Address Verification System) mismatch or you have entered an incorrect security code.</p>
                    <p class="text">If your payment is declined, you will need to provide an alternative payment method or provide another card on which the payment can be charged and processed.</p>
